<h1 align="center"> Hi there, it's Sara! 👋 </h1>

<h2 align="center">A PhD in Artificial Intelligence passionate about biological and artificial Neural Networks 👩‍💻 </h2>

I am **Data Scientist**. I love problem solving, developing Machine Learning models and being creating on how to approach every new problem!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on <a href="https://www.kynetec.com/">Kynetec</a>, on the **Agricultural field**.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills on: Time Series/Forecasting models, Churn prediction, ANN and Databricks, among others.
  
- 👯 I'm keen on keeping in constant learning, so I would like to create and share some secondary projects from outside the work environment as practice and in case it can be of help to other fellow programmers.

- 💬 Ask me about anything you think I can help!


## Where do I come from?
Just for giving you some background from me, these are some info regarding my trajectory until the moment 🤓:
- 📚 I have a bachelor in **Psychology**, that is why I love everything related with how the people behaves.
  
- 🧠 I got my first Master degree in **Cognitive Neuroscience**, from here I found the love on how we think, and how the information is spread on our brains.
  
- 💻 My second Master is on **Bioinformatics and Biostatistics**, what opened me the world to the computation field.
  
- 👩‍🎓 To finalize my studies, I got a ✨**PhD on Artificial Intelligence**✨, on the field of developing a new ML algorithm based on the biological transmission of information. If you are curious, it is published <a href="https://ruc.udc.es/dspace/handle/2183/33359/">HERE</a>!
